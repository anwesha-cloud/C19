A beginner-level project built in 2019 during my early days of learning programming through WhiteHat Jr.

The dinosaur runs automatically, and the player must jump to avoid obstacles.

## âœ… Features

- Uses **p5.js** and **p5.play** libraries
- Dynamic score, cloud & obstacle spawning

## ðŸš€ How to Run
**Step 1:** Open the project folder in **Visual Studio Code**
**Step 2:** Install the **Live Server** extension  
**Step 3:** Right-click on `index.html` â†’ click **"Open with Live Server"**

## ðŸ“˜ Note
This was one of my first projects â€” preserved for learning history.
